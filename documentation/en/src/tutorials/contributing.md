# Contributing to PgDoorman

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PgDoorman! This guide will help you set up your development environment and understand the contribution process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For running integration tests, you only need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (required)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (required)

**Nix installation is NOT required** — test environment reproducibility is ensured by Docker containers built with Nix.

For local development (optional):
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pg_doorman.git
   cd pg_doorman
   ```
3. **Add the upstream repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ozontech/pg_doorman.git
   ```

## Local Development

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

2. **Build for performance testing**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Configure PgDoorman**:
   - Copy the example configuration: `cp pg_doorman.toml.example pg_doorman.toml`
   - Adjust the configuration in `pg_doorman.toml` to match your setup

4. **Run PgDoorman**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

5. **Run unit tests**:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## Integration Testing

PgDoorman uses BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) tests with a Docker-based test environment. **Reproducibility is guaranteed** — all tests run inside Docker containers with identical environments.

### Test Environment

The test Docker image (built with Nix) includes:
- PostgreSQL 16
- Go 1.24
- Python 3 with asyncpg, psycopg2, aiopg, pytest
- Node.js 22
- .NET SDK 8
- Rust 1.87.0

### Running Tests

From the **project root directory**:

```bash
# Pull the test image from registry
make pull

# Or build locally (takes 10-15 minutes on first run)
make local-build

# Run all BDD tests
make test-bdd

# Run tests with specific tag
make test-bdd TAGS=@copy-protocol
make test-bdd TAGS=@cancel
make test-bdd TAGS=@admin-commands

# Open interactive shell in test container
make shell
```

### Greengage

```bash
make test-greengage
```

This starts Greengage 7.5.0 with a coordinator and two primary segments,
then runs `@greengage` in the same Nix environment as the PostgreSQL tests.
The Greengage image is pinned by digest in `tests/nix/greengage.sh`;
ARM64 hosts use amd64 emulation. Each scenario gets a separate database,
and the container is removed after the run. These tests also run in CI.

Select a scenario with `make test-greengage TAGS=@greengage-cleanup-built-in`.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output with the `DEBUG=1` environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=1 make test-bdd TAGS=@copy-protocol
```

When `DEBUG=1` is set:
- Tracing is enabled with DEBUG level
- Thread IDs are shown in logs
- Line numbers are included
- PostgreSQL protocol details are visible
- Detailed step-by-step execution is logged

This is useful when:
- Debugging failing tests
- Understanding protocol-level communication
- Investigating timing issues
- Developing new test scenarios

## Writing New Tests

Tests are organized as BDD feature files in `tests/bdd/features/`. Each feature file describes test scenarios using Gherkin syntax.

### Shell Tests (Recommended for Client Libraries)

Shell tests run external test commands (Go, Python, Node.js, .NET, Java, PHP) and verify their output. This is the simplest way to test client library compatibility.

**Example** (`tests/bdd/features/my-feature.feature`):

```gherkin
@go @mytag
Feature: My feature description

  Background:
    Given PostgreSQL started with pg_hba.conf:
      """
      local all all trust
      host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust
      """
    And fixtures from "tests/fixture.sql" applied
    And pg_doorman started with config:
      """
      [general]
      host = "127.0.0.1"
      port = ${DOORMAN_PORT}
      admin_username = "admin"
      admin_password = "admin"

      [pools.example_db]
      server_host = "127.0.0.1"
      server_port = ${PG_PORT}

      [pools.example_db.users.0]
      username = "example_user_1"
      password = "md58a67a0c805a5ee0384ea28e0dea557b6"
      pool_size = 40
      """

  Scenario: Test my Go client
    When I run shell command:
      """
      export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://example_user_1:test@127.0.0.1:${DOORMAN_PORT}/example_db?sslmode=disable"
      cd tests/go && go test -v -run TestMyTest ./mypackage
      """
    Then the command should succeed
    And the command output should contain "PASS"
```

**Test implementation** (in your preferred language):
- Go: `tests/go/mypackage/my_test.go`
- Python: `tests/python/test_my.py`
- Node.js: `tests/nodejs/my.test.js`
- .NET: `tests/dotnet/MyTest.cs`

### Rust Protocol-Level Tests

For testing PostgreSQL protocol behavior at the wire level, use Rust-based tests. These tests directly send and receive PostgreSQL protocol messages, allowing precise control and comparison.

**Example** (`tests/bdd/features/protocol-test.feature`):

```gherkin
@rust @my-protocol-test
Feature: Protocol behavior test
  Testing that pg_doorman handles protocol messages identically to PostgreSQL

  Background:
    Given PostgreSQL started with pg_hba.conf:
      """
      local all all trust
      host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust
      """
    And fixtures from "tests/fixture.sql" applied
    And pg_doorman started with config:
      """
      [general]
      host = "127.0.0.1"
      port = ${DOORMAN_PORT}
      admin_username = "admin"
      admin_password = "admin"
      pg_hba.content = "host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust"

      [pools.example_db]
      server_host = "127.0.0.1"
      server_port = ${PG_PORT}

      [pools.example_db.users.0]
      username = "example_user_1"
      password = ""
      pool_size = 10
      """

  @my-scenario
  Scenario: Query gives identical results from PostgreSQL and pg_doorman
    When we login to postgres and pg_doorman as "example_user_1" with password "" and database "example_db"
    And we send SimpleQuery "SELECT 1" to both
    Then we should receive identical messages from both

  @session-test
  Scenario: Session management test
    When we create session "one" to pg_doorman as "example_user_1" with password "" and database "example_db"
    And we send SimpleQuery "BEGIN" to session "one"
    And we send SimpleQuery "SELECT pg_backend_pid()" to session "one" and store backend_pid
    # ... more steps
```

**Available Rust test steps:**

Protocol comparison (sends to both PostgreSQL and pg_doorman):
- `we login to postgres and pg_doorman as "user" with password "pass" and database "db"`
- `we send SimpleQuery "SQL" to both`
- `we send CopyFromStdin "COPY ..." with data "..." to both`
- `we should receive identical messages from both`

Session management (for complex scenarios):
- `we create session "name" to pg_doorman as "user" with password "pass" and database "db"`
- `we send SimpleQuery "SQL" to session "name"`
- `we send SimpleQuery "SQL" to session "name" and store backend_pid`
- `we abort TCP connection for session "name"`
- `we sleep 100ms`

Cancel request testing:
- `we create session "name" ... and store backend key`
- `we send SimpleQuery "SQL" to session "name" without waiting for response`
- `we send cancel request for session "name"`
- `session "name" should receive cancel error containing "text"`

### Adding Dependencies

If you need additional packages in the test environment, modify `tests/nix/flake.nix`:
- Add Python packages to `pythonEnv`
- Add system packages to `runtimePackages`

After modifying `flake.nix`, rebuild the image with `make local-build`.
