Feature: COPY Protocol
  Testing COPY protocol support to ensure pg_doorman handles COPY operations identically to PostgreSQL
  Including error cases like bad SQL syntax

  Background:
    Given PostgreSQL started with pg_hba.conf:
      """
      local all all trust
      host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust
      """
    And fixtures from "tests/fixture.sql" applied
    And pg_doorman started with config:
      """
      [general]
      host = "127.0.0.1"
      port = ${DOORMAN_PORT}
      admin_username = "admin"
      admin_password = "admin"
      pg_hba.content = "host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust"

      [pools.example_db]
      server_host = "127.0.0.1"
