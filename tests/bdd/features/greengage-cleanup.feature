@greengage @greengage-cleanup
Feature: Backend cleanup against a real Greengage coordinator and segments
  Every scenario owns a database on the Docker Greengage cluster.
  A pool of one and the next checkout form the cleanup completion barrier.

  Background:
    Given a temporary Greengage database on the configured cluster
