Feature: Prepared statement cache desync on client disconnect before Sync

  When a client sends Parse but disconnects before Sync/Flush,
  pg_doorman registers the statement in the server-side LRU cache
  (via register_parse_to_server_cache with should_send_parse_to_server=false)
  but the actual Parse message is never sent to PostgreSQL (it stays in the buffer
  which is dropped on disconnect). The server cache now thinks the statement exists
  on PostgreSQL, but it doesn't.

  The next client that gets the same server and sends Parse for the same query
  will see has_prepared_statement() = true, skip sending Parse to PostgreSQL,
  and send only Bind — which fails with "prepared statement does not exist".

  Background:
    Given PostgreSQL started with pg_hba.conf:
      """
      local all all trust
      host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust
